      <h2>How I Started</h2>
      <p>Since this is a solo project I was looking for everyday problems and challenges that people face on a daily basis. One day when I was at the cinema I realised how frustrating it can be waiting in line to purchase a movie ticket, especially since the ticket machines were having issues. 

        I began to think about the everyday customer who just wants to arrive get their ticket, pick a seat, their food and go into the screen showing. I imagined the frustrations they would face waiting in line for people, who were indecisive. I thought "how would I correct this inconvenience?"</p>
        <h2>What is better</h2>
        <p>I created an app that provides you with the opportunity to not only book your movie, seating and food in advance, but also gives you the nearest cinema in your area?</p>

        <li> Indecisive people can be an annoyance to other customers.          </li>
        <li> Sometimes the ticket machines have maintenance issues.          </li>
        <li> Not enough staff for customers to be served in a timely manner.          </li>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>Create an App where people can book movie tickets, view listings and order food. The App will be called Scene Cinema. It should be easy to use and intuitive. If it seems to slow, clumsy and or complicated this defeats the purpose.</p>

      <h2>Mood Board And Sketching      </h2>
      <h5>Mood Board      </h5>
      <p>I usually start with a mood board before any sketching. It consists of various websites and apps that I'll collect from my competitors, Pinterest, Dribbble and Google Images

        The purpose of this is just to get some ideas on what fonts to use, colours, layout ideas, interactivity and overall mood. This is similar to me researching about competitors.
       </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h2>Sketching</h2>
      <p>‍After collecting a sufficient amount of inspiration from the mood board, I then go into the low-fidelity sketching phase. This helped me get some ideas down, what ideas to keep and improve upon. I looked into the method of how my competitors go about booking a movie and then I incorporate it into my sketches for better approach, mix & matching whatever ideas I get from the Mood Board.

        It's important to note that I always have the User Stories handy with me. This helps me to figure out if what I'm sketching, falls inline with those requirements.</p>

    <div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
      <h2>Wireframes      </h2>
      <p>After being satisfied with the low-fidelity sketches, I created mid-fidelity for a more accurate representation of the final design. The tool I used is called Balsamiq Mockups.

        This is useful because it helped me to decide to move forward or go back to low-fidelity again.
        The main page for example, I wanted the user to see what movies was the most popular and then be able to go to the movie listings, rather than have them register first</p>

      <h2>More on Wireframes      </h2>
      <p>This is all the wireframes created. During the process I add in some indications of interactivity of what button does what and where it leads to. 
      </br>
      <b>        Prototyping Phase
      </b>
        
        In order to test if the flow works, Balsamiq has a simple prototyping function that connects you to each wireframe by linking a specific button to the next desired page. Based on the User Stories it seemed to work quite well.

      <h2>Colors      </h2>
<p>Choosing colours is key in design, because they can significantly affect the overall design positively or negatively. Psychologically colours have an emotional impact on us and as mentioned before, I wanted something cool and visual, I didn't want to go with blue as a default choice. 

  Using my Mood Board I looked for the colours that I don't see all the time.
  
  One of the designs I saw had utilised purple. It's known to not only be associated with royalty, but also can be wise, creative and imaginative. That's why I chose it as a primary colour, I believed it would be a nice compliment to the cool and visual feel I was going for.</p>  
  <h5>Colour Palette  </h5>     
  <p>I used the website, Coolors.co to experiment with different shades of my primary and other supporting colours.

    Purple is pretty dark and I wasn't going for a dark themed app, so I went for a lighter shade (#734b6d) and used that to create a subtle gradient. Also coupling that with a white background was going the keep the visual aspect alive.</p>

      <h2>UI Design For The Scene Cinema App      </h2>
<p>Once I tested out all usability flow, I started designing the final screens in Figma.</p>
  <h5>Layout  </h5>     
  <p>
    Previously I mentioned that I wanted to couple the subtle gradient with a white background as I wasn't going for a dark themed app. I got this idea to do a wavy background with faded image, from one of the Mood Board designs. It had a sharp angular shape with an image, so I experimented and made it work. 
    
    It was tricky however since there were some info which didn't look readable on the dark gradient background. However a subtle drop shadow fixed that.</p>

<h5>What I felt during this project?</h5>     
<p>This was is my simplest project to I ever done. It was just overwhelming as there many ideas or task I wanted to do but time wasn't on my side</p>

<h5>What I learned?</h5>     
<p>I learned how important it is to really try to understand design from a users perspective, otherwise you design for all the wrong reasons. This essentially leads to a waste of time, an unfulfilling product and an unhappy customer, which is one of my fears.</p>


<h5>Challenges I encountered</h5>     
<p>The colour scheme without a doubt was most challenging. However thanks to the Mood Board which I didn't attach it to this case study and Competitive Research, it gave me a good starting point on how to approach the visual aspect and feeling I was going for.</p>

<h5>Things I should Have Done Better</h5>     
<ul>
  <li>I have discovered a website called CanvasFlip, that allows a recorded demonstration of a prototype. Once I've learned how to use it, it will be apart of my process and I'll be sure to add it in future case studies</li>
  <li>User Testing. This is something that I wanted to do but wasn't sure how to go about it. My UX/UI Designer mentor (Kim), advised me to check out a website, www.usertesting.com in order achieve this. So this will integrated into my process, as I'm sure it will make my designs and my understanding of users more effective.</li>
  <li>In future showcase how I came to the decision for certain designs and show my reasoning.</li>
</ul>
