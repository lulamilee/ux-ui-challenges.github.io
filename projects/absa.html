      <h3><strong>‍</strong>About The Challenge</h3>
      <p>A team of engineering geniuses, along with an investor, are working on a device that can read your blood sugar levels by shining a light right into a vein. A wrist-mounted device can do the job, with an LED, provided the light and sensor stay right on top of the vein<br>Knowing people’s blood sugar levels means you can calculate their calorie intake.<br>
        How might this technology be used to help ordinary people who want to go on a diet because they are overweight? People sometimes want to attain long term goals but don’t have the self-control to succeed. Self-control, and learning new eating habits, is a tricky business.<br>
        And therefore many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it’s highly challenging to track glucose levels accur
        ately without piercing the skin. <br>
        - People envisioned wearable devices, like smart-watches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as 
        Oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. <br>
        - With Holy Grail App will allow users to view their glucose
        level anytime at a glance,you also review how your glucose changes over few hours or days to see trends.<br>
        Seeing glucose changes in realtime can help you make more informed decisions throughout the day about how to balance your food,physical activity, medicine and health.</p>

        <h4  class="rich-kid w-richtext">RESEARCH</h4>
      <h3>Identifying the user needs      </h3>
      <p>In my research, I was supposed to interview several people so I can examine the lifestyle of different people and identifying their needs and the factors that influence their way of living/glucose intake, I wanted answers to questions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the major challenges faced by them based on their life choices?
        </li>
        <li>How do they find help or information about their glucose intake?
        </li>
        <li>Do they take action towards decreasing their glucose intake?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>User Interviews      </h3>
      <p>I was supposed to interview at least eight people people from different lifestyle they live. Most of the people which I wasnt interviewing them but it was open discussion via live chat said that they faced problems in eating healthy food,consistent with their daily healthy diet, preffer junk food,etc. There seemed to be a lack of information about living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
      <h3>Observations</h3>
      <p>I identified problems which people face everyday but don’t usually take notice,act upon them or talk about. The findings showed that the people are glucose but not familiar with practising in healthy living / food.</p>

      <h4  class="rich-kid w-richtext">RESEARCH INSIGHTS</h4>
      <h3>Understanding the problem      </h3>
      <p>I had bring together individuals research data i conducted and created broad or high level theme into which the major challenges faced by the people fell under. The major challenges were:</p>

      <h4> PROBLEM SYNTHESIS  </h4>
      <h3>Affinity Diagramming      </h3>
      <p>To get an in-depth analysis of the qualitative research data we used Affinity diagramming. This session was going help me in categorizing and prioritizing the data of problems, issues and challenges the people are facing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listing Affinity notes according to issues</li>
  <li>Categorizing Affinity notes into different themes</li>
</ul>
<div class="rich-kid w-richtext">
  <h4> USER PERSONA  </h4>
  <h3>Understanding the user  </h3>
<p>I created Personas to represent a user group who face a similar problem. This gave me a clear picture of the user's expectations and how they would like to use a product.</p>

  <h4> BRAINSTORMING  </h4>
  <h3>Exploring ideas & opportunities  </h3>
<p>I was supposed to take the main features from affinity diagramming session and realized that many shortlisted features can be too broad or out of scope for this project. I then will prioritize the list & while mapping them it will appeared that some of the requirements were interconnected or interlinked.</p>

  <h4> FLOW DIAGRAM  </h4>
  <h3>Mapping & organizing information  </h3>
  <p>Designing for the user experience began from sketching out a typical user journey based on the accomplishment of specific tasks within the app. Once the user journey had been established, I had to begin to unpack the design flow for general and specific use cases.  </p>
