          <h3 class="insight-heading">About The Challenge<br></h3>
          <p class="insight-paragraph">A team of engineering geniuses, along with an investor, are working on a device that can read your blood sugar levels by shining a light right into a vein. A wrist-mounted device can do the job, with an LED, provided the light and sensor stay right on top of the vein<br>Knowing people’s blood sugar levels means you can calculate their calorie intake.<br>
            How might this technology be used to help ordinary people who want to go on a diet because they are overweight? People sometimes want to attain long term goals but don’t have the self-control to succeed. Self-control, and learning new eating habits, is a tricky business.<br>
            And therefore many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it’s highly challenging to track glucose levels accur
            ately without piercing the skin. <br>
            - People envisioned wearable devices, like smart-watches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as 
            Oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. <br>
            - With Holy Grail App will allow users to view their glucose
            level anytime at a glance,you also review how your glucose changes over few hours or days to see trends.<br>
            Seeing glucose changes in realtime can help you make more informed decisions throughout the day about how to balance your food,physical activity, medicine and health.</p>

      <p><strong>#2 Sign up and login process <br>‍</strong>Users can login using touch id and voice password in addition to email and password. To Signup users can either use existing email account and enter details or create voice password or create touch id for a fast and secure login in the application.<br></p>

      <p><strong>#4 Creating and sharing achievements <br>‍</strong>Users can create tasks/achievements in anytime and share with other members. The tasks will be synced with their calenders and will receive notifications and reminders. Users can see details like date, time,before and after results of their glucose intake,exercises,weight, etc.<strong>‍</strong></p>
      <p><strong>#5 Learning experience <br>‍</strong>The app asks user if he/she wants to play a quizzes by asking small quiz and allows users to be consistent with their sugar,calorie,exercise,weight.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <h3>Reflection & next steps</h3>
      <p class="des">I was supposed to do user testing & cognitive walkthroughs to find out usability issues in the interface of the app. To find out if users find the application user friendly and could easily navigate between the screens. And which trouble did they come across in understanding the Voice and Chat UI or there were some problems in Login & interest/task selection which we can improved by adding tutorials and tooltips in the onboarding process.
